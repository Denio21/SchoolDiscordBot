# SchoolDiscordBot
Discord Bot for my school class.
This repo is just read-only, it will be hard for you to make it work fine for you - this bot is perfectly made just for my class. If you somehow manage to get it working, be sure you disable supplementation module - its really only for us. 

# Features!

  - Mute for time
  - Role assigment by click to reaction
  - Automatic voting system
  - Event/tasks managment (older than X days are moved to different [archive] channel)
  - Supplementation logging for our school from webpage
  - Auto-reaction in specified channels/emojis to messages, emojis or attachments
  - And other stuff...
